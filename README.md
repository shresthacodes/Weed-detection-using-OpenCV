# Weed Detection Using OpenCV

This project implements a weed detection system using computer vision techniques with OpenCV, presented through a Streamlit web application. It aims to identify and locate weeds in agricultural fields, helping farmers optimize their crop management practices.

## Features

- Image preprocessing for optimal weed detection
- Color-based segmentation to distinguish weeds from crops
- Shape analysis for weed identification
- Visualization of detected weeds on input images
- Streamlit web interface for easy interaction and result display

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shresthacodes/Weed-detection-using-OpenCV.git
   cd Weed-detection-using-OpenCV
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Use the web interface to upload images and view weed detection results.
